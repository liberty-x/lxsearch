## LX Search

## Who?

Liberty-X, a project team in the 6th iteration of the Founders & Coders academy.
Members: Justen Barget, Rachel Black, Huw Davies and Ruth Uwemedimo.

## What?

We will aim to build a dictionary website that searches for the definition of a search bar entry. We will ultimately deploy the app on Heroku.

## Why?

Because who uses an 'Oxford Dictionary' anymore?

### Functionality

User input search term will display the definition of that word on the same page.
A new search will return the new results while deleting the old results.
